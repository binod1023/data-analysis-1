# bike rental data-analysis
This short project analysis records of rental bikes from city of Seattle. The data is extracted from public data url provided by City of Seattle website. 
The comparison of rental trend is done between two sides of Seattle: East and West.
Then rental trend of bike is done over given years. Similarly, trend of renting over months is done, so that we can find in which seaons people rented more bikes.
Similarly, I showed how bike renting is spread over different times of the day. Are people tends to rent bike more during the day, or afternoon, or during evening time.
